# Chess
Its a two player chess game which I built using only c++

If you know how to play chess then you can easily play it as all basic chess rules are applied

I was a beginner developer when I built chess, so I designed its graphics pixel by pixel from start to end on my laptop
which is why this game only works for Devices which have 15.6 inch display with resolution (1920 X 1080)
